## Earn an MA or PhD in Religion 
As part of a major secular public university, the Department of Religion deals with religion as an academic discipline without bias or favoritism for one religious or philosophical tradition over another. Because the academic study of religion is multidisciplinary, our courses draw from history, literature, philosophy, politics, art and the social sciences. While part of the Graduate Program’s purpose is to offer broad yet penetrating coverage of the phenomena of religion in the world in general, it also focuses on certain themes rooted in the expertise of our faculty. 

These themes include the following

- **Critical Investigation of Religion and Human Differences:** This area builds upon and acknowledges our legacy of inter-religious, cross-religious dialogue and critical engagement — a legacy that began 50 years ago. We continue to work among and between religious traditions upholding a strong commitment to te critical considerations of the intersections of religion with race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality and disability. 
- **Historical Texts and Traditions:** This emphasis involves the careful study of texts as an important point of access into religious belief systems, traditions, rituals and practices in their historical (and current) contexts. Among the texts studied are the Hebrew Bible, New Testament and Early Christian texts, Rabbinic texts, Muslim religious and jurisprudential texts, and Chinese (Buddhist, Taoist, Confucian) religious and philosophical texts.
- **Religion and Society:** What is religion’s influence on society? How do social forces influence religion? These questions have gripped intellectuals for centuries, and they remain central to the study of religion today. All scholars of religion must consider certain fundamental social questions. For example, what is the impact of religion on American politics? 

Graduate students in religion take a combination of foundations courses and specialized seminars. Foundations courses cover a broad range of religious traditions. Each course covers the basic thought, practices and history of one of the following: African religions, African American religions, Buddhism, Chinese religions, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam or Judaism. Other Foundations courses deal with methodologies in the study of religion, including historical-textual, social scientific and philosophical approaches. Advanced or specialized seminars deal with religion in context of race and ethnicity, time and place. 

## Academic Partnerships and Exchanges
We have strong relationships with other programs in the [College of Liberal Arts](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/) in addition to outside secular and reigious educational institutions. These include the University of Pennsylvania's Department of Religious Studies, the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College, the Eastern Baptist Theological Seminary and the Lutheran Theological Seminary in Philadelphia. A coordinated MA/PhD program in Islamic-Christian Relations is conducted with Hartford Theological Seminary and a Graduate Certificate in Women's Studies is offered in cooperation with Temple's Women's Studies Program. 

## MA in Religion
Our MA program is designed for students to begin advanced training in religion. If you attend the MA in religion program at Temple, you might continue your education in our PhD program or attend one at another university. Some students are satisfied with completing an MA in religion for personal enrichment or to teach in high schools or community colleges. If you are a professional in fields that include business, social work, medicine, government or journalism, an MA in religion brings increased cultural and cross-cultural analytical tools to your work. If you finish your MA at Temple and decide to continue on to our PhD in religion program, you must complete a separate application.

## PhD in Religion
One of our biggest strengths of our PhD program is our breadth and diversity; students are given a broad and interdisciplinary introduction to Religion in the first unit of study and take courses in other departments and institutions in the second unit of study. We are committed to the multidisciplinary study of global religious traditions; This gives our program an outstanding breadth and cross-cultural diversity. We have a long history of attracting students from all over the world, and our graduates work in major North American, African, European and Asian universities.

## Temple Graduate School Funding
At Temple, we believe that students from all walks of life should have access to an outstanding college education. If you need help paying for graduate school, you aren’t alone. Most students receive some form of financial aid to fund their education. Graduate students are eligible for financial assistance from federal, state, private and university sources. We encourage you to explore all of the opportunities available and apply early to make your education an affordable experience. 

PhD students are awarded financial aid on academic merit. The department nominates our strongest candidates for Graduate School Fellowships, and offers a limited amount of TA-ships. Students from underrepresented groups may also be nominated for [Future Faculty Fellowships](http://www.temple.edu/grad/finances/fff_program.htm). Due to limited resources, the department is not able to provide funding to all students, although the majority receive some funding eventually. University Fellowships, Graduate Assistantships, and Academic Internships are ordinarily reserved for PhD students.
