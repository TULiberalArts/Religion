## Earn an MA or PhD in Religion at Temple University

As part of a major public university, the Graduate Program in Religion at Temple deals with religion as an academic discipline without bias or favoritism for one religious or philosophical tradition over another. Our courses provide graduate students with broad coverage of religious phenomena in the world, but our faculty also provide specialized study in Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Judaism and more. One major area of emphasis is Religion, Race, and Ethnicity. Since the nature of the study of religion is interdisplinary, we have strong cooperative relationships with other programs in the College of Liberal Arts. 

MA or PhD Students studying religion at Temple take two kinds of graduate courses. Foundations courses cover a broad range of religious traditions including African and African American religions, Buddhism, Chinese religions, Christianity, Hinduism, Island or Judaism. These courses provide graduate students a solid background in the basic thought, practices and history of major world religions and methodologies in the study of religion. The second are specialized seminars in subjects that our faculty have expertise in. These include courses dealing with religion, race, ethnicity, and religion in certain time periods and geographic regions. 

Areas of Specialization include:

- African Diaspora Christianity
- Gender & Religious Community
- American Religious History
- Islamic Political Thought
- Animals in Religion
- Death & Dying
- Tibetan Buddhism
- Japanese Philosophy

## MA in Religion
