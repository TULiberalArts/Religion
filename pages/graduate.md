## Earn an MA or PhD in Religion at Temple University
As part of a major public university, the Department of Religion deals with religion as an academic discipline without bias or favoritism for one religious or philosophical tradition over another. Because the academic study of religion is multidisciplinary, our courses draw from history, literature, philosophy, politics, art and the social sciences. Many of our graduates go on to become leaders in their communities. They are teachers, administrators, doctors and lawyers.

We have strong relationships with other programs in the [College of Liberal Arts](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/) in addition to outside secular and reigious educational institutions. These include the University of Pennsylvania's Department of Religious Studies, the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College, the Eastern Baptist Theological Seminary and the Lutheran Theological Seminary in Philadelphia. A coordinated MA/PhD program in Islamic-Christian Relations is conducted with Hartford Theological Seminary and a Graduate Certificate in Women's Studies is offered in cooperation with Temple's Women's Studies Program. 

Graduate students in religion take a combination of foundations courses and specialized seminars. Foundations courses cover a broad range of religious traditions. Each course covers the basic thought, practices and history of one of the following: African religions, African American religions, Buddhism, Chinese religions, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam or Judaism. Other Foundations courses deal with methodologies in the study of religion, including historical-textual, social scientific and philosophical approaches. Advanced or specialized seminars deal with religion in context of race and ethnicity, time and place. 

## MA in Religion
