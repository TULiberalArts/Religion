## Program Overview

The Department of Religion offers full-time graduate programs leading to master’s (M.A.) and doctoral (Ph.D.) degrees. All applicants to the Graduate Program in Religion at Temple must apply either for admission to the M.A. or to the Ph.D. program, and a student’s admission will be to one or the other of these. Students admitted to the Ph.D. program directly may pick up the M.A. degree on the way to their Ph.D. when they have fulfilled the M.A. requirements. Students admitted only to the M.A. program may apply for the Ph.D. program separately upon completing their M.A.; such applications are considered on the same basis as all other new Ph.D. applications.

As a component of a large state-related university, the Graduate Program in Religion at Temple deals with religion as an academic discipline without bias or favoritism for one religious or philosophical tradition over another, nor for any particular form of spirituality or secularism. While part of the program’s purpose is to offer a broad coverage of the phenomena of religion in the world in general, it also possesses certain areas of greater strength according to the specializations and knowledge of its faculty. One area of major emphasis is Religion, Race, and Ethnicity.

Students will encounter two broad categories of graduate courses at Temple. First are general introductory courses, called Foundations courses, for specialists and non-specialists alike. These cover a broad spectrum of religious traditions. Each course covers the basic thought, practices, and history of one of the following: African religions, African American religions, Buddhism, Chinese religions, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, or Judaism. Other Foundations courses deal with methodologies in the study of religion, including historical-textual, social scientific, and philosophical approaches. Foundations courses are designed to provide a broad background both in discrete religious traditions and in methodology for students in the M.A. program or in the first two years of the Ph.D. program. Second are advanced or specialized seminars in the areas of expertise of the professors. These include in particular courses dealing with religion, race, and ethnicity in various traditions, time periods, and areas of the world. Other courses outside of this area are also available. Some specialized seminars may be counted on a case-by-case basis as Foundations courses at the discretion of the director of graduate studies.

## Program Goals

After completing this program, students should be able think critically, write well and engage with diverse communities around the globe. Students leave the program with an appreciation of the diversity of religious expression and an understanding of some of the world’s most important traditions. Because virtually all of our students take our most popular course, Death and Dying, they are able to deal with the persistence of loss in their everyday lives and the lives of their family, friends, and community. Many of our graduates go on to become leaders in their communities. They are teachers, administrators, doctors, and lawyers.

## Degrees And Programs Of Study

- [Master of Arts in Religion](http://bulletin.temple.edu/graduate/scd/cla/religion-ma/)
- [Doctor of Philosophy in Religion](http://bulletin.temple.edu/graduate/scd/cla/religion-phd/#text)

The Department of Religion at Temple University offers a 30-credit master’s degree program designed for the following students:

- For those seeking to qualify for a Ph.D. program in religion or a related field. (Note: Admission to the Temple Ph.D. program requires a new, separate application. See below under “Requirements for Admission into the Ph.D. Program”).

- For those who plan to teach study of religion subject matter in community colleges or high schools.

- For those in various forms of religious ministry who wish to pursue further postgraduate training and exposure to the newest research methods and developments in the understanding of their own or other religious and cultural traditions.

- For those who wish to bring cultural and cross-cultural analytical tools to professions such as business, social work, medicine, government and journalism.
For qualified persons in the general public who would like the opportunity to acquire competence in the study of religions, values, and cultures broadly defined, and in areas of special interest to the student.

## Coursework

Students take at least 12 credits of relevant foundations courses, 12 credits of elective seminars and/or individual study, and 6 additional credits. 3 or 6 credits of this work may be taken in graduate courses outside the department in a cognate field at Temple University. Up to 6 credits may be transferred from approved graduate study elsewhere if relevant to the student’s program. Upon entry to the M.A. program, the new student should consult with the Director of Graduate Studies for advice on the best choice of courses to meet that student’s needs.

No later than at the completion of their first 18 semester hours of coursework the student should choose either the thesis or portfolio option, as well as an advisor for the final project. This choice must be approved by the Graduate Studies Committee. The advisor will have primary responsibility for supervising the student’s work for the remainder of the program and will be the primary reader of the thesis or portfolio. See the graduate bulletin for more information.

The 60-semester-hour (s.h.) Ph.D. program generally includes the following types of courses:

- Foundation courses
- Advanced or specialized courses
- Courses outside religion studies
- Dissertation research (after preliminary exams)

The Ph.D. program is divided into three sequential units of studies:

- Unit I: The first 24 s.h. of courses, including all the required foundation courses, and satisfying a first foreign language requirement. These courses are intended to provide a firm and broad academic base across the field of religious studies. The foundation courses must include 12 s.h. of courses in the basic thought, practices, and history of three particular religious traditions and 3 s.h. in an introductory methodology course. The remaining 9 s.h. consist of advanced or specialized courses chosen by the student for the benefit of his or her program after consultation with the advisor.

- Unit II: The remaining courses and second language competency to complete the required specialization in preparation for the preliminary examinations and the dissertation proposal. These include 24 s.h. of further advanced or specialized courses and 6 s.h. of courses taken outside of the department, for a total of 30 s.h.

- Unit III: The writing and defending the dissertation. The student registers for 6 s.h. of dissertation research, usually one s.h. per semester.

## Admissions Process

Admission requirements to the graduate program in religion follow the general requirements established by the Graduate School at Temple University. Please see the Graduate School Bulletin.

## Careers

Graduate students who have successfully completed the master’s program or the doctoral program in religion have a host of opportunities for employment awaiting them. Based on the data the Department of Religion has collected over a 20-year period, the clear majority of graduates have found jobs in higher education, with most of them finding tenure-track positions in colleges and universities. Others have secured employment in higher education administration; as full-time clergy combined with administration of theological centers or theological schools; in chaplaincies in health care facilities or the armed services; as senior technical writers at private sector corporations or foundations; and as administrators at interfaith centers. Those who pursue a graduate degree in religion have a solid foundation to translate their degree into a wide variety of jobs.

## Graduate Studies Program Guide

As a component of a large state-related university, the Graduate Program in Religion at Temple University treats religion in a scholarly manner without bias or favoritism for one religious or philosophical tradition over another, and without preference for any particular form of spirituality or secularism or any single methodological or theoretical approach. While part of the Graduate Program’s purpose is to offer broad yet penetrating coverage of the phenomena of religion in the world in general, the Program also possesses certain thematic areas of greater strength rooted in the specializations and knowledge of its faculty, namely Critical Investigation of Religion and Human Differences; Historical Texts and Traditions; and Religion and Society.

## Religion And Human Differences

This area builds upon and extends the Department’s rich and engaged tradition of investigating the complexities and contours of religious pluralism and cultural diversity in our ever-globalizing world. It acknowledges and parlays our legacy of inter-religious and cross-religious dialogue and critical engagement—a legacy that began nearly 50 years ago with the inception our program as a department of world religions in a large, urban, secular American research university. From that time forward we have continued to do work among and between religious traditions, while increasingly grafting onto this legacy a strong commitment to critical considerations of the intersections of religion, race, ethnicity, gender, sexualities, and disabilities, exploring in relation fault lines within, as well as points of contact among and between, various religious traditions. As such, Temple scholars engaged in the Religion and Human Differences emphasis area also work to challenge the east/west and mind/body divides through work across a full range of human differences as they impact, inform, and also challenge various religious traditions, just as they complicate our analyses of them.

## Historical Texts And Traditions

Careful study of texts provides an important point of access into religious belief systems, traditions, rituals, and practices in their historical contexts, thereby also shedding light on their contemporary manifestations. This area aims to produces scholars who are sensitive yet critical readers of religious texts grounded in scholarly methodologies of interpretation. A sustained focus on a range of texts in primary languages concerning various traditions, areas, practices, and religions in historical contexts represents both the cornerstone and the taproot of Texts, Histories, and Traditions. Among the scriptural texts studied by scholars in this area are the Hebrew Bible, New Testament and Early Christian texts, Rabbinic texts, Muslim religious and jurisprudential texts, and Chinese (Buddhist, Taoist, Confucian) religious and philosophical texts. Students engaged in this area of study develop critical analytical skills through training in scholarly reading strategies and approaches, such as historical and literary analysis, hermeneutics, and the history of reception and interpretation.

## Religion And Society

What is religion’s influence on society? How do social forces influence religion? These questions have gripped intellectuals for centuries, and they remain central to the study of religion today. Their primary foci notwithstanding, all scholars of religion are on some level forced to consider certain fundamental social questions, recognizing now more than ever that, for example, religious rituals, whatever their spiritual motivations, are parts of larger social realities; that religious symbols signify social structures in addition to unseen divine entities or theological notions; and that religious scriptures, however divinely inspired, are physically written and subsequently interpreted by socially positioned human beings. Religion and Society incorporates a range of methodological and theoretical approaches, from sociology and anthropology, to social ethics and feminist theology, and offers a scholarly platform for the analysis of an even broader range of substantive issues, like, for example, Marian devotion in sixth century Byzantium or twentieth century Haiti; Islamic identity in medieval Iberia or contemporary New York; or the ethical and political dimensions of religion in the United States.

These areas are further complimented by the expertise of faculty members in a variety of religious traditions, such as African and African diasporic religions, Buddhism, Christianity, Daoism, Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism, and in various methodological and theoretical approaches to the study of religion, such as the anthropological, comparative, historical, philosophical, psychological, sociological, textual, and theological.

Students in the Program are offered two broad categories of graduate courses. First are general introductory courses, called Foundations courses, for specialists and non-specialists alike, which are further divided into two types. Foundations courses of the first type cover respectively the beliefs, practices, and histories of the following: African Religions, Chinese religions, Christianity, Hinduism, Indian Buddhism, Islam, Japanese Buddhism, or Judaism. Foundations courses of the second type, meanwhile, cover various theoretical and methodological approaches to the study of religion, including historical-textual, philosophical, and social scientific. Foundations courses are designed to provide a broad background both in discrete religious traditions and in theory and methodology for students in the M.A. program or in the first two years of the Ph.D. program. The second category of courses consists of Advanced or Specialized seminars in the areas of expertise of the religion faculty. These include, among other examples, courses dealing with the intersections of religion with race, class, ethnicity, gender, and/or sexualities, or with comparative or dialogical religious thought, in various traditions, time periods, and areas of the world. Occasionally, some specialized seminars may be counted on a case-by-case basis as Foundations courses at the discretion of the Director of Graduate Studies.

All applicants to the Graduate Program in Religion at Temple must apply for admission either to the M.A. or to the Ph.D. program, and a student’s admission will be to one or the other of these. Students admitted to the Ph.D. program directly may pick up the M.A. degree on the way to their doctorates when they have fulfilled the M.A. requirements. Students admitted only to the M.A. program may apply for the Ph.D. program separately upon attainment of their Master’s degrees; such applications are considered on the same basis as all other new applications to the doctoral program. Because applications for the M.A. and the Ph.D. programs are handled separately and according to different criteria, as will be explained below, much of the rest of this program guide deals with these two programs separately.

Early in their graduate careers, students should gain familiarity with the information contained in this [Graduate Studies Program Guide](http://www.cla.temple.edu/religion/files/2014/02/Grad-Studies-Program-Guide-13-14.pdf) and with the [Temple University Graduate Policies and Procedures](http://www.temple.edu/grad/policies/gradpolicies.htm), a Graduate School document that is available online. In addition, students should watch for notices, electronic or other, from the Graduate School, and for occasional email notices and postings on the Graduate Religion Studies bulletin board. Students are ultimately responsible for fulfillment of the requirements of the program. Finally, before commencing their graduate studies, and at intervals during a program as their interests develop, students should determine whether or not their intended areas of specialization resonate effectively with the resources and strengths of the department.

This Program Guide, which may be altered from time to time, outlines the structure of the current curriculum and the procedures for advancement in the graduate program. The provisions of this Program Guide do not constitute the offer of a contract that students may accept through admission and enrollment in the university. The university and the department reserve the right to change the provisions, offerings, or requirements at any time within the student’s period of study at the university. We do not award a degree for the completion of a definite number of courses alone, but upon determination of the competence of the candidate in the chosen subjects of study. Students will find a spirit of healthy concern on the part of the faculty here to help them obtain the degree they are pursuing and employment in the field beyond, as desired. If necessary, however, that same faculty will be frank to recommend to them that they discontinue.
