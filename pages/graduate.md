## Earn an MA or PhD in Religion
As part of a major secular public university, Temple University’s Department of Religion treats religion in a scholarly manner without bias or favoritism for one religious or philosophical tradition over another and without preference for any particular form of spirituality or any single methodological or theoretical approach. The academic study of religion is multidisciplinary and draws from these faculty-driven themes:

- **Critical Investigation of Religion and Human Differences:** This area builds upon and acknowledges our legacy of interreligious, cross-religious dialogue and critical engagement—a legacy that began 50 years ago. We continue to work among and between religious traditions upholding a strong commitment to the intersections of religion with race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality and disability.
- **Historical Texts and Traditions:** This emphasis involves the careful study of texts as an important point of access into religious belief systems, traditions, rituals and practices in their historical (and current) contexts. Among the texts studied are the Hebrew Bible, New Testament and Early Christian texts, Rabbinic texts, Muslim religious and jurisprudential texts, and Chinese (Buddhist, Confucian, Taoist) religious and philosophical texts.
- **Religion and Society:** What is religion’s influence on society? How do social forces influence religion? These questions have gripped intellectuals for centuries, and they remain central to the study of religion today. All scholars of religion must consider certain fundamental social questions. For example, what is the impact of religion on American politics? What is bovine veneration and why does Hinduism encourage it?

Students in our MA or PhD in Religion degree programs take a combination of foundations courses and specialized seminars. Foundations courses cover a broad range of religious traditions. Each course covers the basic thought, practices and history of one of the following: African religions, African American religions, Buddhism, Chinese religions, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam or Judaism. Other Foundations courses deal with methodologies in the study of religion, including historical-textual, philosophical and social scientific approaches. Advanced or specialized seminars deal with religion in context of ethnicity, place, race and time.
