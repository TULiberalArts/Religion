## Earn an MA or PhD in Religion
As part of a major secular public university, the Department of Religion at Temple treats religion in a scholarly manner without bias or favoritism for one religious or philosophical tradition over another and without preference for any particular form of spirituality or any single methodological or theoretical approach. The academic study of religion is multidisciplinary; our courses draw from themes rooted in the expertise of our faculty.

Please visit the [Religion Graduate Admissions page](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/admissions/graduate/religion) to learn more about graduate program requirements, dates and deadlines and instructions on how to apply. _We strongly encourage PhD applicants to reach out to faculty members currently accepting students prior to applying to the program_.

These themes include the following:

- **Critical Investigation of Religion and Human Differences:** This area builds upon and acknowledges our legacy of inter-religious, cross-religious dialogue and critical engagement — a legacy that began 50 years ago. We continue to work among and between religious traditions upholding a strong commitment to the intersections of religion with race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality and disability.
- **Historical Texts and Traditions:** This emphasis involves the careful study of texts as an important point of access into religious belief systems, traditions, rituals and practices in their historical (and current) contexts. Among the texts studied are the Hebrew Bible, New Testament and Early Christian texts, Rabbinic texts, Muslim religious and jurisprudential texts, and Chinese (Buddhist, Confucian, Taoist) religious and philosophical texts.
- **Religion and Society:** What is religion’s influence on society? How do social forces influence religion? These questions have gripped intellectuals for centuries, and they remain central to the study of religion today. All scholars of religion must consider certain fundamental social questions. For example, what is the impact of religion on American politics? What is bovine veneration and why does Hinduism encourage it?

Students in our MA or PhD in Religion programs take a combination of foundations courses and specialized seminars. Foundations courses cover a broad range of religious traditions. Each course covers the basic thought, practices and history of one of the following: African religions, African American religions, Buddhism, Chinese religions, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam or Judaism. Other Foundations courses deal with methodologies in the study of religion, including historical-textual, philosophical and social scientific approaches. Advanced or specialized seminars deal with religion in context of ethnicity, place, race and time.

## MA in Religion

## Temple Graduate School Funding
Financial assistance may be awarded to PhD students based on academic merit.  The Religion Department nominates the strongest candidates for University Fellowships, and offers a limited number of Teaching Assistantships.

**University-Awarded Fellowships**
Students are nominated for Presidential, University, and Future Faculty Fellowships by the Department of Religion which are administered by the Graduate School. While on fellowship, students must take a minimum of nine academic credits each semester during the Fall and Spring semesters.  

**Teaching Assistantships**
Teaching Assistants are required to provide 20 hours of service per week to Temple. TAs receive tuition remission for courses (up to nine credits) that contribute to the student’s program of study, plus a stipend.
 
The Scholarship Awards Committee makes Teaching Assistantship decisions in the Spring semester.  Currently enrolled PhD students who wish to be considered for an assistantship must submit an application to the Chair of the Scholarship Awards Committee.  New applicants for the PhD program are automatically considered.

We reserve University Fellowships and Teaching Assistantships for PhD students. Due to limited resources, the department is not able to provide funding to all students.
