## Earn an MA or PhD in Religion at Temple

As part of a major public university, the Graduate Program in Religion at Temple deals with religion as an academic discipline without bias or favoritism for one religious or philosophical tradition over another. Our courses provide graduate students with broad coverage of religious phenomena in the world, but our faculty also provide specialized study in Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Judaism and more. One major area of emphasis is Religion, Race, and Ethnicity. 

MA or PhD Students studying religion at Temple take two kinds of graduate courses. Foundations courses cover a broad range of religious traditions including African and African American religions, Buddhism, Chinese religions, Christianity, Hinduism, Island or Judaism. These courses provide graduate students a solid background in the basic thought, practices and history of major world religions and methodologies in the study of religion. The second are specialized seminars in subjects that our faculty have expertise in. These include courses dealing with religion, race, ethnicity, and religion in certain time periods and geographic regions. 

## MA in Religion

Students in our 30-credit MA in Religion program include those who plan on teaching religious studies community colleges or high schools, college grads in other fields who have an interest in religion and students who plan on continuing on to PhD programs in religion. While some graduates from our master’s program may choose to apply for PhD in Religion program at Temple, it is a separate process.  If you work in another profession, understanding religious context is essential to cross-cultural understanding. Notable examples include health services, social work, international business and government.

## Financial Aid

Most students receive some form of financial aid to help them pay for graduate school. The FAFSA, or Free Application for Federal Student Aid, is the primary form that the government, states and Temple University use to award grants, scholarships, work study and student loans. Filling out the FAFSA often results in a substantial boost in financial assistance. The department offers a limited number of assistantships and scholarships on a highly competitive basis. The awards usually involve teaching or assisting one or more faculty with instructional duties. We encourage you to explore all of the opportunities available and apply early to make higher education an affordable experience for you.
