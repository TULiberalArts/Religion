## Earn an MA or PhD in Religion at Temple University
As part of a major public university, the Department in Religion at Temple University deals with religion as an academic discipline without bias or favoritism for one religious or philosophical tradition over another. Our courses provide graduate students with broad coverage of religious phenomena in the world, but Department of Religion faculty also lead specialized study in major world religions. Because the academic study of religion is multidisciplinary, our courses draw from history, literature, philosophy, politics, art and the social sciences.
We have strong cooperative relationships with other programs in the College of Liberal Arts. 

Graduate students in religion take a combination of foundations courses and specialized seminars. Foundations courses cover a broad range of religious traditions. Each course covers the basic thought, pracices and history of one of the following: African religions, African American religions, Buddhism, Chinese religions, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam or Judaism. Other Foundations courses deal with methodologies in the study of religion, including historical-textual, social scientific and philosophical approaches. Advanced or specialized seminars deal with religion, race and ethnicity in various traditions, time periods and areas of the world. 

### MA in Religion
Our MA in Religion program is designed for the following students

- Students who want to qualify for a PhD program in Religion or a related field (While some graduates from our master’s program apply for the Temple's PhD in Religion program, it is a separate process.)
- People wo want to teach religion in community college or high school. 
- Members of religious ministry who want to further understanding of their own religion or other religious and cultural traditions.
- Other professionals in fields that include business, social work, medicine, goverment or journalism who want to bring increased cultural and cross-cultural analytical tools to their work.
- Anyone with a BA who wants to acquire more knowledge of religion and cultures.

### PhD in Religion
One of our biggest strengths of our PhD program is our breadth and diversity; students are given a broad and interdisciplinary introduction to Religion in the first unit of study and take courses in other departments and institutions in the second unit of study. We are committed to the multidisciplinary study of global religious traditions. This gives our program an outstanding breadth and cross-cultural diversity. We have a long history of attracting students from all over the world, and our graduates now work in universities in North America, Africa, Europe and Asia.
