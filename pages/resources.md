## Associations and Affiliations
The Department has been strengthened over the years by connections to other universities in our region and around the globe. We have had a vital exchange program with the University of Tübingen in Germany, and another with Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. We benefit from consortial agreements with the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, Palmer Theological Seminary, Lutheran Theological Seminary, The Reconstructionist Rabbinical College, and Westminster Theological Seminary. 

### Journal of Ecumenical Studies
Our department houses and edits the Journal of Ecumenical Studies (J.E.S.), the premier journal in inter-religious conversation. Co-founded and edited by Leonard Swidler in 1964, a professor of Catholic Thought and Interreligious Dialogue at Temple, J.E.S is the first peer-reviewed journal in the field. After more than 50 years, J.E.S. continues as the premier publisher of scholarly articles in the field of dialogue across lines of religious difference. Published initially as an intra-Christian endeavor, it quickly evolved into an organ of Christian-Jewish dialogue and then further expanded to include all the world’s major religions and ideologies, including atheism. 

### The Dialogue Institute
The Dialogue Institute (DI) is based at Temple University and is associated with the Journal of Ecumenical Studies. The DI leads and sustains a movement of interreligious and intercultural dialogue within an academic setting and on a global scale. In partnership with the Temple University Department of Religion, the DI offers graduate courses and opportunity for independent study in the area of Interreligious Dialogue. Graduate student interns contribute original research and produce new resources to further interreligious understanding and action. For more information contact the [Dialogue Institute office](mailto:info@dialogueinstitute.org).

### Study Abroad Programs
Temple students can study abroad in almost any country through our programs, exchanges and partnerships with organizations around the world. The benefits of studying abroad are immense; studying abroad will change your life more than any other part of your college experience. Study Architecture in Rome, Spanish in Ecudor or intern in Singapore. Take advantage of your opportunity to live, study and intern in another country for college credit. Where will you go?

### Graduate Organizations
- **Department of Religion Graduate Student Association:** As a student in the Religion Department, you are automatically a member of the Graduate Student Association (GSA). This is a free and voluntary association, which was organized to give support and a voice to graduate student concerns. By participating in GSA, you contribute to the life and shape of our department. Temple University’s Department of Religion holds a permanent seat on the National Committee for Graduate Students of the American Academy of Religion (AAR).
- **American Academy of Religion**: The American Academy of Religion (AAR) is the major professional association of religion scholars and is closely associated with the Society of Biblical Literature. Graduate students in our programs are encouraged to join these organizations, both of which provide reduced student rates. MA or PhD students are also encouraged to present papers or serve on panels at meetings, and our department normally defrays part of the expense. 
- **Council on Graduate Studies in Religion**: The Department of Religion is a long-standing member on the Council on Graduate Studies in Religion (CGSR). The Council is a consultative body made up of over 30 preeminent institutions in the United States and Canada that offer a PhD in Religion, Religious Studies or Theology. Members meet once a year, usually concurrently with annual meetings of the American Academy of Religion and the Society of Biblical Literature. CGSR takes up a broad range of issues in graduate education in religion and theology.
