## Associations and Affiliations
The Department has been strengthened over the years by connections to other universities in our region and around the globe. We have had a vital exchange program with the University of Tübingen in Germany, and presently enjoy another with Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. We also continue to benefit from our consortial agreements with the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, Palmer Theological Seminary, Lutheran Theological Seminary, The Reconstructionist Rabbinical College, and Westminster Theological Seminary. Faculty and graduate student exchanges based on these agreements have greatly enhanced academic life in the Department over the years, as they do today.

### Journal of Ecumenical Studies
Our department houses and edits the Journal of Ecumenical Studies (J.E.S.), the premier journal in inter-religious conversation. Co-founded and edited by Leonard Swidler in 1964, a professor of Catholic Thought and Interreligious Dialogue at Temple, J.E.S is the first peer-reviewed journal in the field. After more than 50 years, J.E.S. continues as the premier publisher of scholarly articles in the field of dialogue across lines of religious difference. Published initially as an intra-Christian endeavor, it quickly evolved into an organ of Christian-Jewish dialogue and then further expanded to include all the world’s major religions and ideologies, including atheism.

### Undergraduate Awards
- **Earle E. and Orpha N. Elder Memorial Scholarship**
- This scholarship was established to support undergraduate students majoring in religion, with a preference for students planning on Christian service.
- **Religion Department Prize for Academic Excellence**
- This prize is awarded by the Religion Department to a graduating senior whose work in religion has been outstanding.
- **Religion Department Merit Prize**
- This prize is awarded by the Department of Religion to a graduating senior who has achieved academic excellence and contributed intellectually and socially to the undergraduate life of the department.

### Graduate Organizations
- **Department of Religion Graduate Student Association:**
- The Graduate Students Association (GSA) of the Department of Religion is the organization through which students are represented on various committees. All current graduate students are members, and active participation is voluntary. Active participation is voluntary, and officers and representatives are elected. The primary task of elected graduate students is communication among students. Representatives attend departmental faculty members, and participate in the Graduate Studies Committee and the Scholarship Awards Committee. Temple University’s Department of Religion holds a permanent seat on the National Committee for Graduate Students of the American Academy of Religion (AAR), and the liaison person can provide information about the AAR and the Society of Biblical Literature (SBL).
- **American Academy of Religion**
- The American Academy of Religion (AAR) is major professional associations of religion scholars. They publish journals, hold annual national and regional meetings and sponsor employment listings. Graduate students in our programs are encouraged to join these organizations, both of which provide student rates. MA or PhD students are also encouraged to present papers or serve on panels at meetings, and our department normally defrays part of the expense. 
- **Society Of Biblical Literature**
- The Society of Biblical Literature (SBL), founded in 1880 as the Society of Biblical Literature and Exegesis, is a constituent society of the American Council of Learned Societies (since 1929), with the stated mission to "foster biblical scholarship".
- **Council on Graduate Studies in Religion**
- The Department of Religion is a long-standing member on the Council on Graduate Studies in Religion. The Council is a consultative body made up of over 30 preeminent institutions in the United States and Canada that offer a PhD in Religion, Religious Studies or Theology. Members meet once a year, usually concurrently with annual meetings of the American Academy of Religion and the Society of Biblical Literature. CGSR takes up a broad range of issues in graduate education in religion and theology.
