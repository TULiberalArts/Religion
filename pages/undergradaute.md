## Major in Religion at Temple
If you are interested in working in education, environmental policy, finance, health care or for non-profit groups, consider a major or minor in Religion. A BA in Religion provides you with a range of immediately useful skills that will help you navigate these areas and more. Studying Religion also helps you develop a depth of knowledge about how cultures form, how different communities grow, why conflicts arise and how they are resolved. The Religion major requires only 30 credits and our entry courses regularly overlap with subjects in other areas of study. Our courses are often cross-listed with anthropology, classics, critical languages, English, history, classics, critical languages and sociology.

## Minor in Religion
Many students find that with only a few additional courses they can add Religion as a second major, or minor in Religion as a complement to their primary field of study. The minor in Religion is an excellent addition to the degree programs in the [College of Liberal Arts](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/) or other colleges throughout Temple University. If you have an interest in world history and providing sensitive patient care, minoring in Religion will be especially helpful.
