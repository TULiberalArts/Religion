## BA in Religion
From Syrian refugees to the voting habits of evangelical Americans, understanding religion is key to putting context to current and historical events. If you major in religion at Temple, you will be guided through the comparison of religious traditions and their encounters with one another by leading scholars. The Bachelor of Arts in Religion is a solid Liberal Arts degree that provides undergraduates with the intellectual, analytical, communication and interpersonal skills essential you need for success. Majoring in religion is flexible by design; it easily accommodates study abroad programs, internships or a second major or minor. 
Whether you are interested in Buddhist thought, Islamic law, Daoist classics, Jewish mysticism or African American spirituality, our faculty works with you to design a personalized academic plan.
