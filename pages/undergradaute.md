## BA in Religion

Religious studies, alternately known as the study of religion, is the multi-disciplinary academic field devoted to research into religious beliefs, behaviors, and institutions. Understanding religion is an essential part of being a well-informed liberal arts student, and it enhances studies a broad range of other displines. If you major in religion, you'll be guided through the comparison of religious traditions and their encounters with one another by leading scholars in the field. The Temple department of religion, located in the historical and cultural mecca of Philadelphia, prepares students for life in a pluralistic culture.
