## Learn Outside The Classroom

We host events with guest speakers from a variety of backgrounds. Lectures by filmmakers, journalists, musicians, writers, archaeologists and graphic artists regularly give students a direct window into major issues relating to religious communities and ideas.

## A Well-Rounded Education

Both graduate schools and prospective employers recognize that by studying religion, students engage with a wide variety of ideas, forms of communication and systems of social organization that are extremely useful in developing important professional skills.
