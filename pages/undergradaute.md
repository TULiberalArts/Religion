## Bachelor of Arts in Religion at Temple
If you’re interested in working in education, environmental policy, finance, health care or for nonprofit groups, consider a major or minor in Religion. A BA in Religion degree provides you with a range of immediately useful skills that will help you navigate these areas and more. The Religion major only has 30 required credits, and our entry courses regularly overlap with subjects in other areas of study. Our courses are often cross-listed with Anthropology, Greek and Roman Classics, critical languages, English, History and Sociology.

## Minor in Religion
Many students find that with only a few additional courses they can add Religion as a second major, or minor in Religion as a complement to their primary field of study. The minor in Religion is an excellent addition to the degree programs in the [College of Liberal Arts](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/) or other colleges throughout Temple University. If you have an interest in world history and providing sensitive patient care, minoring in Religion will be especially helpful.
