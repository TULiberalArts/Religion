## Bachelor of Arts in Religion

The Bachelor of Arts in Religion is a solid liberal arts degree, providing students with the essential knowledge base and the intellectual, communication and interpersonal skills essential to success in any career. Drawing from history, literary studies, philosophy and the social sciences, the academic study of religion is multidisciplinary. If you join our program, you'll be guided through the comparison of religious traditions and their encounters with one another by leading scholars in the field.  

You do not need a particular religious background or commitment to study religion, and our program is one of the most diverse at Temple University. Both our students and faculty members come from many different religious traditions, cultures, ethnic backgrounds, genders and sexualities. We believe that being exposed to different perspectives enhances creativity and prepares students to live in a pluralistic global society. 

## Choose Your Own Adventure

Individualized study allows for extensive ownership over your education. Our program is flexible, and you can tailor your studies to focus on your interests. Whether it be Buddhist thought, Islamic law, Christian origins, Jewish philosophy, African American spirituality, Hindu metaphysics, or Confucian and Daoist classics, you’ll work with faculty to design your own personal program of study and research. 

## Learning Outside the Classroom

In addition to traditional instruction, we host events with guest speakers from a variety of backgrounds. Lectures by filmmakers, journalists, musicians, writers, archaeologists and graphic artists regularly give students a direct window into major issues relating to religious communities and ideas.

## Minor in Religion

## What Can I do with a Degree in Religion?

Cultural sensitivity, analytical thinking and sharp communication skills are necessary for careers that include public service, diplomacy, journalism, counseling, research, social work, health and human services, conflict resolution and government. Some students continue their education in doctoral programs, law school, medical school or prepare for the ministry.

## Financial Aid and Scholarships

If you need help paying for college, you aren’t alone. Most college students receive some form of financial aid to fund their education. The FAFSA, or Free Application for Federal Student Aid, is the primary form that the government, states and Temple University uses to award grants, scholarships, work study and student loans.  Filling out the FAFSA, often results in a substantial boost in financial assistance.
