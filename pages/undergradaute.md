## Learn Outside The Classroom

We host events with guest speakers from a variety of backgrounds. Lectures by filmmakers, journalists, musicians, writers, archaeologists and graphic artists regularly give students a direct window into major issues relating to religious communities and ideas.

## A Well-Rounded Education

Both graduate schools and prospective employers recognize that by studying religion, students engage with a wide variety of ideas, forms of communication and systems of social organization that are extremely useful in developing important professional skills.

## Program Overview

The Bachelor of Arts in Religion is a solid liberal arts degree, providing graduates with the knowledge base and the intellectual, communication, and interpersonal skills essential to success in any career. More specifically, knowledge of religion – and the ability to think clearly and communicate effectively about it – is valuable in fields that involve public affairs, international and cross-cultural relations, religious issues or groups, or interaction with diverse individuals and populations. While it provides insights into the role of religion in personal, group, and societal identity and conflict, studying religion does not require any particular religious background or commitment.

The department places major emphases on three dimensions in the study of religion:

- The faculty and course offerings provide an introduction to the major religions of the world, with an emphasis on the comparison of traditions and their encounters with one another. Instruction is offered in African and African American religions, Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and Daoism.

- The program stresses the engagement of religious traditions with the major trends and issues – social, political, and ethical – in contemporary culture and society. 

- Students are introduced to the major methods of study in religion, with stress on critical analysis of religions by the methods of the humanities and social sciences, including textual and historical analysis, philosophical and hermeneutical studies, and social and cultural analysis.

The program thus ensures that the faculty and students will find themselves involved in a continuing conversation about methods for the study of religion and the multiple relations of religious traditions to one another and to the contemporary world. Course seminars, departmental forums, and faculty-student interest groups serve to engage students in the diversity and dialogue in the study of religion.
Whether it be Buddhist thought, Islamic law, Christian origins, Jewish philosophy, African American spirituality, Hindu metaphysics, Confucian and Daoist classics, religion and contemporary American society, or interreligious dialogue, students can choose from a variety of faculty and courses designing their own individualized programs of study and research. Religion is a pervasive, powerful, multifaceted, and enduring dimension of human experience. Religions have shaped complex cultures and countless individual lives. They are influential in the world today and will continue to be so in the future. The academic study of religion is multidisciplinary, drawing upon approaches from history, literary studies, philosophy, and the social sciences. It is multicultural, exploring the beliefs, practices, and development of particular religious communities in many different cultures. The Temple Religion Department is one of the most diverse in the university, with faculty members and students of many different religious traditions, cultures, and academic and personal perspectives. The richness of religious and cultural life in Philadelphia and the region provides a valuable context for the study of religion and of religious traditions and communities.
