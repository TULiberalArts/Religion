## Associations And Affiliations

## Department Of Religion Graduate Student Association

The Graduate Students Association (GSA) of the Department of Religion is the organization through which students are represented on the various department committees. All current students are members, and active participation is voluntary. The GSA elects its officers, whose task is communication among students. It also elects representatives to the monthly departmental faculty meeting, to the Graduate Studies Committee, to the Scholarship Awards Committee, and to other groups. Voting representation on these committees gives graduate students a voice in departmental decisions. The GSA holds an orientation program in the fall, offers special meetings for general communication and social events, and publishes an occasional newsletter. An additional medium of communication among graduate students is via the graduate students’ computer discussion list, RELGSA@TEMPLE.EDU. Temple University’s Department of Religion holds a permanent seat on the National Committee for Graduate Students of the American Academy of Religion (AAR), and the liaison person can provide information about the AAR and the Society of Biblical Literature (SBL).

## The American Academy Of Religion And The Society Of Biblical Literature

The AAR and SBL are the major learned and professional societies in the field of religion studies. They publish journals, hold annual national and regional meetings, and sponsor employment listings and information exchanges. Graduate students are encouraged to consider membership in these organizations, both of which provide student rates. Graduate students are also encouraged to present papers at their national and regional meetings, and the department normally defrays part of the expense of attending for students who are presenting papers or serving on panels.

The Department of Religion is a long-standing member of the Council on Graduate Studies in Religion and of the Philadelphia Consortium on the Study of Religion.
