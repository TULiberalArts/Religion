## Why Study Religion in College?
Religion is an inescapable force in every culture. It courses through everything from art and sexuality to politics and scientific discourse. Understanding religious context is essential to being a well-informed student of the humanities and social sciences. Taking college courses in religion prepares you for living in a pluralistic and diverse global culture, and enhances studies in a broad range of other academic disciplines. Plus, If you study religion, you'll develop an in-demand skill set that prepares you for a career in public service, journalism, civil service, social work and more.

Students who study at the Department of Religion at Temple University examine the beliefs, values, rituals, text and artifacts of 
all the world's major religions. Our department provides courses in Buddhist, Islamic, Jewish African American and Christian studies with an emphasis on the comparison and intersection of their traditions. Our department houses the Journal of Ecumenical Studies, which supports our efforts toward inter-religious conversation. Founded in 1961, the Department of Religion is fueled by the wisdom that if you only know one religion, you actually don’t know any.
