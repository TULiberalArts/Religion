  Understanding what religion is and how it works has never been more important. Religious worldviews factor

## Why Study Religion?
Founded in 1961, Temple University’s Department of Religion was one of the earliest religion departments established at a public or state-related university. Although emerging out of an erstwhile school of theology in a private Baptist college, the department has seen itself as distinct from seminaries and religion departments in religiously based institutions since its inception. 

Fueled by the wisdom that if you know only one religion you actually don’t know any, our mission has always been global and culturally pluralistic in its scope. Our faculty consists of scholars with expertise in a wide range of religious traditions and methodological approaches to the study of religion. As such, in addition to researching the contents of religious tradition histories, we take seriously the ways that religion “improves the human condition and uplifts the human spirit,” to quote the Temple University Mission Statement, though without forsaking the critical analysis of religion’s capacity to sometimes darken that condition and stifle that spirit.

## A Broad and Diverse Learning Community
The diversity of our undergraduate and graduate students mirrors that of the broader Temple community in terms of race, ethnicity, religious affiliation or non-affiliation, gender, sexuality and national origin. Most graduate students come to our religion master’s degree and PhD programs with the primary goal of developing their expertise in a single religious tradition through critical analysis. Many also have a secondary goal of deepening their understanding of that tradition by studying others and by mastering leading theories and methodologies in the field. 

The program is designed with these goals in mind, thereby ensuring that our graduates are capable of teaching outside of their primary areas of expertise. This is partly responsible for our graduates’ excellent track record in gaining faculty appointments in an impressive range of colleges, seminaries and universities. It also reflects one of the department’s great strengths: providing students—graduate and undergraduate alike—with a broad background in numerous religious traditions and a heightened awareness of the way religion functions in American and increasingly interconnected global societies.

## Major or Minor in Religion
Our department is fueled by the wisdom that if you know only one religion you actually don't know any—our mission is global and culturally pluralistic.
