## Why Study Religion in College?
Understanding what religion is and how it works has never been more important. Religious worldviews factor strongly into the arts, business, diplomacy, law, medical, politics, practice and public health. We offer instruction in African American religions, Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Daoism, Hinduism, Islam and Jewish studies.
