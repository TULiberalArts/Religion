## Why Study Religion in College?
Religion is an inescapable force in every culture. It courses through everything from art and sexuality to politics and scientific discourse. Understanding religious context is essential to being a well-informed student of the humanities and social sciences. Students who study at the Department of Religion at Temple University examine the beliefs, values, rituals, text and artifacts of all the world's major religions. Instruction is offered in African American religions, Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and Daoism. Fueled by the wisdown that if you know only one religion you actually don't know any, our mission is global and culturally plualistic.
