Religion is a pervasive, powerful, multifaceted and enduring dimension of human experience. Religions have shaped complex cultures and countless individual lives. Students who study religion at Temple University examine the beliefs, values, rituals, text and artifacts of traditions that include Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity and Judaism. Founded in 1961, the Department of Religion is fueled by the wisdom that if you only know one religion, you actually don’t know any.

## Interdisciplinary Studies in Comparative Religion

Temple University provides courses in all major religions, with an emphasis on the comparison and intersection of their traditions. Instruction is offered in African and African American religions, Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Hinduism, Judaism and Daoism. The department is the home of Jewish Studies and Islamic Studies, and houses The Journal of Ecumenical Studies, which supports our efforts toward inter-religious conversation.

## Why Study Religion at Temple?

Understanding religious context is essential to being a well-informed student of the humanities and social sciences. Taking college courses in religion prepares you for living in a pluralistic and diverse global culture, and enhances studies in a broad range of other disciplines. If you study religion, you'll develop an in-demand skill set that prepares you for a career in public service, journalism, civil service, social work and more. Many of  our PhD and MA graduates now work in major universities in North America, Europe and Asia.
