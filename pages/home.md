## Why Study Religion in College?
If you study at Temple's Department of Religion you'll examine the beliefs, values, rituals, text and artifacts of all the world's major religions. We offer instruction in African American religions, Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and Daoism. Understanding religious context is essential to being a well-informed student of the humanities and social sciences. Our department is fueled by the wisdown that if you know only one religion you actually don't know any - our mission is global and culturally plualistic.
