A major in Religion gives students a deeper understanding of how religion plays a critical role in everyday life. By teaching our students to examine how religion influences forming group identities, shaping memory and understanding history, they gain the knowledge necessary to analyze the impact of religion on critical events around the world.

Our courses are taught by internationally respected experts in their fields, and our faculty is deeply committed to helping students develop critical thinking skills with real-world applications.

Religion students learn from a variety of classic literary works, develop important cultural literacy and work to find solutions about how different religious groups can engage in productive dialogue.
