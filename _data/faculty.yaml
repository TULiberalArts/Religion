   Dr. Sydney White grew up in Hana, Maui, Hawai’i, received her B.A. in Anthropology from Bryn Mawr College in 1979, and her Ph.D. in Medical Anthropology from the University of California at Berkeley in 1993. Her scholarly work on the politics of medical knowledges and cultural identities in Maoist and post-Mao China has been rooted in a long-term research relationship with the People’s Republic of China (PRC) which began in 1981. Dr. White’s Yunnan Province-based research in both Lijiang and Kunming has served as the foundation for numerous publications on a range of topics related to medicine, identity, and power in the Chinese state. These include the following: the embodied politics of gender and ethnicity among the Naxi of the Lijiang basin, the politics of rural versus urban residence in shaping post-1949 Naxi cultural citizenships, the dramatic transfor mations in rural PRC health care during both the Maoist and post-Mao periods, the epistemological contours of the rural PRC practice of “integrated Chinese and Western medicine” (zhongxiyi jiehe) and the hegemony of Chinese medical knowledges over “Western medicine” (xiyi) that these reveal, the role of the “medicine of systematic correspondence” (Confucian medicine) in the “civilizing” and citizenship projects of the Chinese imperial, Republican, and socialist states–particularly the post-1949 scientized narrative of Chinese medicine (zhongyi) of the socialist Chinese state, the distinctive contours of narratives of socialist Chinese modernity reflected by shifts in Maoist and post-Mao medical and minority policies, the changing faultlines of stigmatized categories of cultural identity as revealed through the unfolding of the HIV/ AIDS epidemic in Yunnan over the past twenty years, the political-economy of ethnicity for the Naxi of the Lijiang basin—with an emphasis on Maoist and post-Mao transformations, and encompassing the impact of massive-scale ethnic tourism on Lijiang over the past decade and a half. As a sociocultural medical anthropologist, Dr. White has always used the politics of medicine and identity in the context of the U.S. state as a comparative touchstone for her work on the Chinese state. Since coming to Temple as a faculty member in 1993, Dr. White has provided extensive service to the College of Liberal Arts, to the University, and to the profession of anthropology. She has also provided extensive mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students, having supervised fifteen PhD students, and having served on the PhD committees of twenty-five other graduate students over the past twenty years.

   David Harrington Watt is Professor of History at Temple University, where he is also an affiliated faculty member in the Department of Religion. He received an A.B. from the University of California at Berkeley and a Ph.D. from Harvard University. Watt is a member of the Temple Association of University Professionals, the Friends Association for Higher Education, the American Historical Association, and the American Academy of Religion. He served on one of the committees that drew up the American Academy of Religion's recently-issued Statement on Contingent Faculty Practices. The statement is, among other things, an effort to encourage members of the American Academy of Religion to reflect on the causes and consequences of universities' heavy reliance on contingent faculty. Most of Watt's articles and books focus on the history of religion in North America. In A Transforming Faith, Watt examined the intellectual history of fundamentalism and evangelicalism in the middle decades of the twentieth century. In Bible-Carrying Christians, he used ethnographic research to rethink the relationship between religion and social power in Reagan's America. Along with Simon A. Wood, Watt edited a collection of original essays called Fundamentalism: Perspectives on a Contested History. Those essays analyzed what scholars lose and gain when they deploy the concept of fundamentalism to analyze the religious practices and political activities of Christians, Jews and Muslims. Together with Tracy Fessenden and Laura Levitt, Watt edits a book series sponsored by New York University Press -- North American Religions -- that highlights creative explorations of religious phenomena in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Anti-fundamentalism, Watt's analysis of Americans' responses to the invention of religious fundamentalism, will be published by Cornell University Press in 2017. Watt's current research focuses on liberal Quakers in the modern United States.
